# Heart Disease Detection Using Decision Tree

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a heart disease detection system using the Decision Tree machine learning algorithm. The project is designed to assist medical professionals by predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.

## 📁 File Overview

- `Tanko.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the entire code workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building using Decision Tree, model evaluation, and conclusion.

## 🚀 Features

- Uses Decision Tree Classifier for prediction
- Evaluates model with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Supports visualization of feature importance and decision tree
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

## 📊 Dataset

The notebook uses a heart disease dataset containing patient information such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Max Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia
- Target (1: disease, 0: no disease)

> **Note:** Ensure the dataset is available in the same directory or modify the path accordingly.

## 🧪 Installation and Running
